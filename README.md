A modern, performant approach to sorting arrays.

## Why ffsort?
We designed ffsort to be lightweight and portable with zero dependencies. It works almost anywhere, making it ideal for production environments. The simplicity of the algorithm combined with the elegancy of the execution make ffsort the definitive sorting solution.

## What can it do?
This library does two things and it does them well; sort an array in ascending or descending order. No overhead or useless additions, just as God intended.

## How does the algorithm work?
The simplicity of ffsort is its biggest strength. The algorithm randomly shuffles the array, checks to see if it's sorted, and repeats until it is. This way there's no room for error.
